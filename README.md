# ASD - Tower Defense
An Open-Source and Cross-Platform Tower Defense Game

## Project history
This game has been the subject of two projects within an engineering school in Switzerland (heig-vd). The first part (v1.0) was conducted during a course of Algorithms and Data Structures (where ASD from French). This latter was then taken (v2.0) for a course in Software Engineering to integrate a network game mode. It has also been improved on a slew of other aspects including the game engine, the GUI, design, etc. 

## Why this Tower Defense is different than others ?
There are a large number of "Tower Defense" games but in most of them, creatures move on a fixed path. In this game there is no predefined path, you must slow the creatures strategically to prevent them from reaching your castle. To achieve this, the player can place the towers on the ground to force the creatures to move in another path. Thus the player can determine the path that the creatures will follow.

## Why we create this project ?
This draft end of the semester is to create a fun application that implement algorithms and data structures studied during courses. We chose to create a variation of the game "Tower Defense" in which creatures move from point A to point B as an optimal path. The player's goal is to place towers to prevent these creatures to arrive at point B.
The goal here was to create an application "tutorial" (it is an interactive software for learning knowledge) to be presented in future during this academic unit. This project will indeed show a real application using algorithms associated graphs (particularly research shortest path between two nodes, known as "Dijkstra's algorithm").
